# ynab-userscripts

Userscripts to extract transaction data into a format usable by YNAB, generally
QIF.

Scripts always add an extra button that needs to be clicked to perform the
export.

## Rakuten Card

Parses the very confusing CSV format, cleans the Payee field noise and produces
an easily imported QIF file.
